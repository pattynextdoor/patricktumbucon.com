    <h1 id="dear">Dear Kimmy,</h1>
    <p>
      Though we started out on Tinder, I knew that we wouldn't end there.

      We've done quite a bit together, and we're only 4 months in. I appreciate our moments like trips to Boiling Point, spending the holidays with my family, watching Tik Toks in bed, and making coffee for you.

      I'm proud of you for all your hard work. It's tough sometimes, but you always come out strong. I can't believe that you're able to balance multiple jobs, an internship, school, and orgs all at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But despite all the grinding, you still find a way to make me feel special, no matter the situation.

      I love your willingness to help others, it makes me strive to be a better person. That's the kind of person I cherish in my life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
