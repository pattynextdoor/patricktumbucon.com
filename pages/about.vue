      <h2>What I've been up to</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="https://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, based in Redmond, Washington. I work on ML/AI insights for  
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/identity-governance-overview">Azure Active Directory Identity Governance</a>. I attended
        <a href="https://ucr.edu">UC Riverside</a>, pursuing a BS in Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I've built upon fraud-predicting ML systems at 
        <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a>, increased search presence at
        <a href="https://esri.com">Esri</a>, professionally developed students at 
        <a href="https://acmucr.org">ACM@UCR</a>, and organized multiple events at 
        <a href="https://citrushack.com">Citrus Hack</a>.

      <h2>What I do in my free time</h2>
      <p>
        Back when we were able to go outside, I enjoyed relaxing at coffee shops, climbing rocks,  and attending music festivals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, you can find me at home <a href="https://patricktumbucon.com/posts/v60-pourover">making my own coffee</a>, tending to my 16+ houseplants, attempting to bake, playing video games with friends on Discord, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kimmykn/video/6901901222337449222?lang=en">obsessively staring at my saltwater nano reef tank.</a>
