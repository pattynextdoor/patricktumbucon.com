      <h2>What I've been up to</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a senior computer engineering undergraduate at 
        <a href="http://ucr.edu">UC Riverside</a>. From there, I'll
        be heading to 
        <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> in Seattle, Washington. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I've increased search presence at
        <a href="http://esri.com">Esri</a>, professionally developed students at 
        <a href="http://acmucr.org">ACM@UCR</a>, and organized multiple events at 
        <a href="http://citrushack.com">Citrus Hack</a>.

      <h2>What I do in my free time</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy relaxing at coffee shops, climbing rocks, playing strategy games (and Smash Bros), and attending music festivals.
