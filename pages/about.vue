      <h2>What I've been up to</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Software Development Engineer at <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>, based in Seattle, Washington. I work in  
        <a href="https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/transaction-risk-management-systems">TRMS</a>, where we utilize machine learning to prevent seller fraud before it can happen. I graduated from  
        <a href="http://ucr.edu">UC Riverside</a> with a BS in Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I've increased search presence at
        <a href="http://esri.com">Esri</a>, professionally developed students at 
        <a href="http://acmucr.org">ACM@UCR</a>, and organized multiple events at 
        <a href="http://citrushack.com">Citrus Hack</a>.

      <h2>What I do in my free time</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy relaxing at coffee shops, climbing rocks, playing strategy games (and Smash Bros), and attending music festivals.
