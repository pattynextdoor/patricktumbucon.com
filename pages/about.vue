      <h2>What I've been up to</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Software Development Engineer at <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>, based in Seattle, Washington. I work in  
        <a href="https://amazon.jobs/en/business_categories/customer-trust-and-partner-support">CTPS</a>, where we utilize machine learning to prevent seller fraud before it can happen. I graduated from  
        <a href="http://ucr.edu">UC Riverside</a> with a BS in Computer Engineering.

        Previously, I've increased search presence at
        <a href="http://esri.com">Esri</a>, professionally developed students at 
        <a href="http://acmucr.org">ACM@UCR</a>, and organized multiple events at

      <h2>What I do in my free time</h2>
      <p>
        Back when we were able to go outside, I enjoyed relaxing at coffee shops, climbing rocks,  and attending music festivals.

        Nowadays, you can find me at home <a href="https://patricktumbucon.com/posts/v60-pourover">making my own coffee</a>, tending to my 16+ houseplants, attempting to bake, playing video games with friends on Discord, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kimmykn/video/6901901222337449222?lang=en">obsessively staring at my saltwater nano reef tank.</a>
