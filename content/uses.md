These are the peripherals, machines, bytes and living things that I interact with. I like them. They're cool. I'll try to keep this up-to-date.

### Workstation

- While technically also my *play*station, my [custom PC build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/yDq3Pn) is also a great developer machine, though I do prefer Mac for work. While I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember, I never had anything remotely close to a gaming computer until I could afford to build a decent one myself (May 2020). This thing rips through 1440p, 144hz gameplay incredibly smoothly.

- The [Keychron K1 (Blue Switches)](https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Ultra-Thin-Wireless-Bluetooth-Mechanical/dp/B07YJSMNFL/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1) feels amazing, the response is quite tactile. Solid build quality too. My favorite part about this keyboard though is its low-profile keys, which feel similar to the Apple Magic Keyboard. The blue switches are too clicky for me though. I also wish there were custom low-profile keys available on the market, but I'm stuck with the stock keys.

- [Blue Yeti Nano](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-Premium-Recording-Streaming/dp/B07DTTGZ7M/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1) - Okay, I got this so I could sound better on Discord voice channels. It's useful for work calls too, I guess. But this thing does its job, and it does it very well in a small package.

- I got the [VicTsing Extended Gaming Mouse Pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794WBPHK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) as my mouse was occasionally unresponsive to some movements. Feels great to move a mouse on. The number of frags I get in Valorant is directly proportional to the condition of me owning this mouse pad, just saying. It also helps with me actively keeping clutter out of arm's reach.

### Editor

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I used Atom as my first serious editor, but the community support and lightweight feel of VS Code is unparalleled. 
- The key bindings for [Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) - I just can't *not* use Vim bindings in a development environment anymore. Whether I'm on my home editor with an emulator plugin or ssh'd to a Linux server, Vim is there for me. The learning curve is steep, but you soon learn how to navigate with your cursor. Then you have *delete a line* and *record and repeat a macro* ingrained in your muscle memory. It's a very rewarding way to edit files, to say the least. Train your Vim skills, it will pay off!
- **Color themes** - the part of my editor I spend the most time on.
  - [Pop N' Lock Theme by Luxcium âœ¨](https://vscodethemes.com/e/Luxcium.pop-n-lock-theme-vscode)
  - [New Moon](https://taniarascia.github.io/new-moon/)
  - [Oceanic Next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.theme-oceanicnext)
  - [Halcyon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brittanychiang.halcyon-vscode)
- [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview) - Cool font. I change this on a whim though.
