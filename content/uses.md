These are the peripherals, machines, bytes and living things that I interact with. I like them. They're cool. I'll try to keep this up-to-date.

### Workstation

- While technically also my *play*station, my [custom PC build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/yDq3Pn) is also a great developer machine, though I do prefer Mac for work. While I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember, I never had anything remotely close to a gaming computer until I could afford to build a decent one myself (May 2020). This thing rips through 1440p, 144hz gameplay incredibly smoothly.

- The [Keychron K1 (Blue Switches)](https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Ultra-Thin-Wireless-Bluetooth-Mechanical/dp/B07YJSMNFL/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1) feels amazing, the response is quite tactile. Solid build quality too. My favorite part about this keyboard though is its low-profile keys, which feel similar to the Apple Magic Keyboard. The blue switches are too clicky for me though. I also wish there were custom low-profile keys available on the market, but I'm stuck with the stock keys.

- I use the [Gigabyte M8000X](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16826146014#) mouse. I got it as a gift a few years ago, and it has held up well (though the middle click is sometimes unresponsive). You can adjust the DPI, though I usually keep it at the lowest setting (800). It's a bit too gamer-looking for my tastes.

- [Blue Yeti Nano](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-Premium-Recording-Streaming/dp/B07DTTGZ7M/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1) - Okay, I got this so I could sound better on Discord voice channels. It's useful for work calls too, I guess. But this thing does its job, and it does it very well in a small package.

- I got the [VicTsing Extended Gaming Mouse Pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794WBPHK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) as my mouse was occasionally unresponsive to some movements. Feels great to move a mouse on. The number of frags I get in Valorant is directly proportional to the condition of me owning this mouse pad, just saying. It also helps with me actively keeping clutter out of arm's reach.

- The speakers on both sides of my desk are the [Klipsch R-51PM Powered Speakers](https://www.klipsch.com/products/r-51pm-powered-speakers). I love how you don't need a dedicated receiver, which would add to my cable clusterfuck. Easy bluetooth connectivity is great for *always* being connected, but with my work Macbook, it does this weird thing where no audio plays anywhere (YouTube, calls, etc.) if you start and pause your Spotify music. The mitigation is playing a Spotify track and muting it in the application, but it's mildly annoying to do so.
  - The sound is incredibly bright on its own, though you definitely need a subwoofer to balance out the mids and highs. I have a [Yamaha 10" 100W sub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XRB1JZS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on top of a [sound dampening platform pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SVRM6L0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) as to not upset my downstairs neighbors.

### Editor

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I used Atom as my first serious editor, but the community support and lightweight feel of VS Code is unparalleled. 
- The key bindings for [Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) - I just can't *not* use Vim bindings in a development environment anymore. Whether I'm on my home editor with an emulator plugin or ssh'd to a Linux server, Vim is there for me. The learning curve is steep, but you soon learn how to navigate with your cursor. Then you have *delete a line* and *record and repeat a macro* ingrained in your muscle memory. It's a very rewarding way to edit files, to say the least. Train your Vim skills, it will pay off!
- **Color themes** - the part of my editor I spend the most time on.
  - [Pop N' Lock Theme by Luxcium âœ¨](https://vscodethemes.com/e/Luxcium.pop-n-lock-theme-vscode)
  - [New Moon](https://taniarascia.github.io/new-moon/)
  - [Oceanic Next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.theme-oceanicnext)
  - [Halcyon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brittanychiang.halcyon-vscode)
- [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview) - Cool font. I change this on a whim though.
